This wasn't specific to any particular language - they seemed to mean it as a general programming principle. I'm pretty confused because I thought error handling with try-catch was fundamental to most modern programming languages. I know it can be misused (like catching exceptions and doing nothing, or using exceptions for control flow), but completely avoiding it seems extreme. Is there some programming philosophy or best practice I'm missing here? Are there alternatives to try-catch that are considered better? Or is my boss maybe referring to specific anti-patterns that I should be aware of? Has anyone else encountered this 'no try-catch' philosophy? What are the actual best practices around exception handling across different languages? Any insight would be really helpful - I want to understand if there's something legitimate here or if I should push back on this guidance.</p>",

I've heard that <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> have block scope while <code>var</code> has function scope, but I'm not entirely sure what that means in practice. Also, when should I use <code>const</code>? Is it just for values that won't change, or are there other reasons to prefer it? Are there any performance implications or best practices around using these different variable declarations? I'd love some clarity on this topic!</p>",
